# Boss Fight Reflection

### What was the hardest part of this project? Why did you have a harder time with this part? (Minimum 2 Sentences)

> *Hardest part for me in this project was making a shooting mechanism, where the speed at which the ball is launched depends on how long you the space. It was hard because it was difficult to track the speed of the ball while the space was pressed and then released.*

### What part or parts of this project did you find easy? Why were these parts easier? (Minimum 2 Sentences)

> *The movement of the ball was the easiest part becuase it only moves in y direction and I was able to use code from previous project to make the movements.*

### Debugging is an important part of the iterative design process. Describe a bug you encountered and how you went about fixing it. (Minimum 4 Sentences)

> *I have was having a bug with the amount of tries players gets each round, even though on the screen it printed the player has 0 balls left to shoot it still have them one more tires. To fix it I looked at each line of code at a time to see what's going on. First I subtracted from amount of tries when the ball came to a stop, which didn't work so then I changed it to so that it subtracts from the tries when the space is released which means the ball is shot. This fixed the problem.*

### What is a feature of GMS2 that you learned about when doing this project? How do you plan to use this feature in future projects? (Minimum 2 Sentences)

> *Few new features I used of GMS2 was friction and move_bounce() functions. These were helpful for creating accurate collsions and movements. Very useful in fruture projects where accurate movement need to be made.*
